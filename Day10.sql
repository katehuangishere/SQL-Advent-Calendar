You are tracking your friends' New Yearâ€™s resolution progress. 
Write a query to calculate the following for each friend: number of resolutions they made, number of resolutions they completed, and success percentage (% of resolutions completed) and a success category based on the success percentage:
- Green: If success percentage is greater than 75%.
- Yellow: If success percentage is between 50% and 75% (inclusive).
- Red: If success percentage is less than 50%.
